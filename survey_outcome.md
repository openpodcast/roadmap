# What have learned after interviewing podcast hosts

We have used the questions in [SURVEY.md](SURVEY.md)
to interview several podcast hosts to fond out what challenges they are facing.

## Results

- Hosting platforms used
  - Springcast
  - Buzzsprout
  - Podlove
  - Podigee
  - Acast
  - Linkfire (for link tracking)
- Collection of statistics from external platforms (e.g. Spotify and Apple) is cumbersome and people would love to have an aggregated view
- Demographics are missing (only Spotify)
- It is difficult to track people and attribute new users to marketing campaign (even a user sees the campaign, she might directly go to her favorite podfetcher to listen to the podcast)
- Metrics of hosting platforms are very basic. E.g. comparison of performance of episode is difficult
- Tracking of links in shownotes is difficult (e.g. for sponsors) and should be automatically tracked
- Collecting feedback is difficult: star rating for episodes would be nice (interviewee compared it to e-reader)
- Linktree or similar landing page which links to podfetchers would be nice (included in buzzsprout)
