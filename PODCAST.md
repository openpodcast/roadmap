# TOPP - The Open Podcast Podcast

## Context: The Open Podcast project
In the Open Podcast project, we develop a new open platform aiming to support the open and independent podcast ecosystem. It solves one of the biggest challenges for podcast hosts to become independent of big platforms such as Spotify and Apple: analytics and listening behavior. The platform consists of three main components. The Open Podcast Analytics API is an open standard for podcast players. It is complemented by a reverse-proxy component to transparently collect data until the standard has been widely adopted. Furthermore, an importer allows the consolidation of analytical data provided by big platforms such as Spotify. This triangle builds a solid analytical foundation for independent podcast hosts to choose an alternative to the big players on the market. 

## The Podcast about the Open Podcast project

What would be the best way to report and inform about the progress of an Open Podcast platform? Exactly, a podcast.

### Concept TOPP podcast

We're sure we'll learn a lot about podcasts as we dive deeper into the
ecosystem. This podcast aims at sharing those learnings with a wider audience and at the same time, promoting the open platform we develop.

### Build in public approach

The podcast is one major keystone of our *build in public* approach which enables us to communicate with a knowledgable audience while also promoting the project itself. The targeted audience consists of people who are interested in the technical part of podcasts and their creation and publishing processes. In the podcast, we share our learnings but also aim for an active exchange with the audience to collect feedback as early as possible and learn from the audience. Espacially podcast hosts and podcast agencies face a lot of challenges which we want to solve. The podcast can help us to understand thos challenges and find potential partner for the future.

### Format

The podcast will be released weekly and consists of a quick update about the project and intersting findings in the podcast ecosystems. The episodes will be as short as possible and shouldn't exceed 15 minutes. This measure should increase the acceptance as the value for time is optimized. 

### Hosts

The podcast is hosted by Matthias Endler and Wolfgang Gassler.
