# TOPP - The Open Podcast Podcast

We're sure we'll learn a lot about podcasts as we dive deeper into the
ecosystem.

We thought we could take you on this journey, so we decided to start our own
podcast. It will help us understand the ecosystem issues from the ground up.

Our mission is to create a conversation about the podcast ecosystem and educate
listeners about the current challenges podcast hosts are facing.
We hope this will help make the space a little more open.
